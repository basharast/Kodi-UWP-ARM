Kodi, formerly known as XBMC Media Center, is an award winning free and open
source software media-player and entertainment hub for all your digital media.
Kodi is available for Linux, Mac OS X (Leopard, Tiger and Apple TV) and
Microsoft Windows, as well as the original Xbox game console. Created in 2003
by a group of like minded programmers, Kodi is a non-profit project run and
developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software
developers have contributed to Kodi, and 100-plus translators have worked to
expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.

While Kodi functions very well as a standard media player application for your
computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC.
Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls, and combined with its
beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, Kodi feels very natural to
use from the couch and is the ideal solution for your home theater. Once
installed, your computer will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.

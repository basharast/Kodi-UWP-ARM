From discussions earlier on the slack team channel and following on from recent events, I was asked to propose a code of conduct for bans and user banning on the forum, to be followed by all with moderator powers. 

1. When required and when the case is clear, spambots and spam accounts should be dealt with using the "Goodbye Spammer" moderator tool. However if the user/post is not 100% certainly spam, then a second opinion must be sought on the slack #moderator channel as once GBS is used, it cannot be undone.

2. For users repeatedly asking for support for banned add-ons or those ignoring warnings or legitimate moderator requests then the normal "three strikes" rule should be applied, with an official warning after the second strike and a short ban (up to one week) applied after the third strike.

3. Where users are being abusive, aggressive or otherwise in violation of the forum rules, warnings should be given when possible, but if a ban is necessary then a second opinion must be obtained, unless the ban is very temporary, 3 days or less, with the explicitly stated reason of cooling heads. This second opinion may be obtained either on the slack channel or by using the forum report post feature with the request that another moderator review the situation and take action if they agree it necessary. Lengthy bans (anything over 3 months) should be done as a team decision. Each ban from this section, whether long or short, shall include a note explaining the reason for the ban so that there is no confusion later.

4. If you are personally involved with the issue under discussion, or if there are any other conflicts of interest which may prejudice fair and judicial usage of moderator powers, then you have to avoid any direct involvement beyond highlighting the problem to the moderator team.

5. Normally if a ban is to be lifted or modified it should be done by the original moderator who imposed the ban. But if the situation requires it, the ban may be reviewed by the moderator team as a whole, and if the majority decides that a change or revoke is required then the change may be made (and no further changes made without a second discussion).

This code applies to all users with moderator powers on the board, and must be followed by them. At the moderator team's discretion, failure to do so may result in suspension or removal of such powers for a period of initially a week, with longer periods considered for more serious issues.

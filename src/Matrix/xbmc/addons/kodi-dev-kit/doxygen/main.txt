### Welcome to the Documentation of Kodi for Add-On Development.

__KodiÂ®__ media center, formerly known as XBMC Media Center, is a free and
open-source media player software developed by the XBMC Foundation, a non-profit
technology consortium. Kodi is available for multiple operating systems and
hardware platforms, with a software 10-foot user interface for use with
televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos,
music, such as audio and video podcasts from the internet, and all common
digital media files from local and network storage media.

Add-ons are extensions that can be run from inside the Kodi GUI and in
addition to binary add-ons for the use of different systems. They are usual
written by third party developers and published to our official repository.
Add-ons can also be published in other repositories or as stand alone zip
files anywhere on the internet. Examples of Add-ons include video website
streams, scrapers, skins and scripts.

#### Supported systems

Currently support Kodi Add-Ons based upon Python and C++.

#### Tutorials and Examples

In the distribution of the library  you find the two directories *tutorials*
and *examples*. They contain subdirectories for the packages...
The demos use third party libraries for the graphical user interface. The
examples don't have this dependency and most examples are refered to in the
user manual.

#### License

Kodi is distributed under a [GNU General Public License version 2](./LICENSE.md).

Moderation Rules - Originally posted by Kib on the forum.

With great power comes great responsibility, and it is important to not misuse the power we have received.
Below are a set of basic rules for the forum moderation that we have come up with.
In case a rule is missing that you think should be added, feel free to discuss.

**Writing posts or replies**
- Be civil, no matter how infuriating other persons are. 
- Unsure what to do? Ask a fellow moderator or the team in this forum!

**Editing posts**
- Never edit posts without explaining that you did so in your edit.
- Editing to remove harmful content is OK.
- Editing broken links or confusing misspelling to fix them is OK
- Editing posts because you do not agree with what was said, is NOT ok.

**Deleting posts or whole threads**
- Don't. It's much more preferred to move them to the garbage or edit the offending bits out (See above)
- For spam: use the stopforumspam link in the top right of the post, or ask an admin when that is not possible.

**Moving threads**
- When moving threads, when possible leave a non-permanent redirect for a number of days. 7 is a good number, but 3 works as well. Use your own intuition. Wink
- Reply to the thread stating that you moved it, ergo "Moved to support section because this does not belong in Android development"

**Sticking / Unsticking threads**
- When in doubt, don't stick or unstick
- Only sticky threads that will be valid for a long time.
- Do not sticky many threads, it gets in the way of browsing the forum
- If many threads are stickied, it is usually better to consolidate the information by making a reference sticky that points to all the threads
- Contact the author before unstickying threads

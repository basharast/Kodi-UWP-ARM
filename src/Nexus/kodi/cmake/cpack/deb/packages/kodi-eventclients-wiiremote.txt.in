# kodi-eventclients-wiiremote debian package metadata
#
# Setting PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS to 'ON' will cause CPack to use dpkg-shlibdeps to
# automatically generate the package dependency list and append its output to
# PACKAGE_DEPENDS list. Only useful for packages that contain binaries.
#
# PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE should be set to 'all' only if package contains
# architecture agnostic data. CPack will set proper architecture (amd64/i386/etc)
# based on build options.
#
# Remaining settings are (hopefully) self-explanatory.

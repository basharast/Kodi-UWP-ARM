/*!
 * \brief This class implements in-game saves.
 *
 * \details Some games do not implement state persistence on their own, but rely on the frontend for
 * saving their current memory state to disk. This is mostly the case for emulators for SRAM
 * (battery backed up ram on cartridges) or memory cards.
 *
 * Differences to save states:
 * - Works only for supported games (e.g. emulated games with SRAM support)
 * - Often works emulator independent (and can be used to start a game with one emulator and
 * continue with another)
 * - Visible in-game (e.g. in-game save game selection menus)

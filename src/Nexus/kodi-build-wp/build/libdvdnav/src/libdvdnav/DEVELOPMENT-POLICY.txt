This fork of (the fork of) dvdnav was created to overcome the lack of
responsiveness of the official development channel (once again).

This new fork will try to simplify, stabilize, fix the security issues and the
numerous crashes and maintain a correct player-agnostic library for DVD playback.

This fork will try to maintain correct authorship tracking and a community
management.

When developing code:
- Try to not add code to expose the internals of dvdnav, unless necessary
- Try to maintain and extend the API in an compatible manner
- Try to not add code that binds applications to side-effects of the library
- Don't remove pre-existing code because your player doesn't need

When committing code to the repository always follow these rules:
- Maintain compilability of the library for every commit
- Split cosmetical and functional changes in different commits
- One change == One commit
- Keep the coding style consistent
- If you break something by accident, fix it as soon as possible.
- Trivial patches such as spell fixes, prototype mismatch, missing includes,
  more proper variable typization and similar can be committed right away

Please don't break these rules, or we'll need to act :)

Libnfs components fall under two separate licences


The library sources and include directories
===========================================
The nfs client library itself, i.e. the lib and include directories,
is licenced under GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

The protocol definition, .x, files
==================================
These are based on old RFCs and studying how wireshark dissects various packets.
These are distributed under the simplified BSD licence.

The files generated from the .x files
=====================================
The files that are generated from the .x sources,
i.e. */libnfs-raw-<protocol>.[ch]
can be considered to be distributed under the simplified BSD licence.

These files are only provided as a convenience, so that you do not need to
install and run rpcgen on the *.x files locally.
If you disagree with the simplified BSD licence I provide them under
then just delete them and then generate identical copies of these files yourself
using "make compile_rpc" in each protocol subdirectory.

Then you can pick whatever licence you want on those files.

The examples directory
================================
The utility and example applications using this library, i.e. the
examples directory, are licenced under the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the
License, or (at your option) any later version.


To avoid any confusion, every source file contains a licence boilerplate.

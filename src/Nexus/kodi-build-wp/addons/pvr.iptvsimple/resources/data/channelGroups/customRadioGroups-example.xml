<!--

Custom Channel Groups:
 - Allows users to create a bespoke list of groups to load.
 - For each name that matches a group name from the M3U include it in the channels loaded
 - channelGroupName is the only value to be set

If you are creating your own Custom Channel Groups file make a copy of this file in the same directory so it's not overwritten and start from there.

NOTE: IF YOU MODIFY THIS FILE IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN NEXT TIME THE ADDON IS STARTED
